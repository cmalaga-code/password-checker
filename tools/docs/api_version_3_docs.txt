403	Forbidden — no user agent has been specified in the request

Acceptable use
The API has been designed to make it easy for people to do awesome things with it. Things that are not awesome include:

Querying the data for purposes that are intended to cause harm to the victims of data breaches
Anything deliberately intended to limit service availability such as denial of service attacks
Deliberate attempts to circumvent measures designed to ensure acceptable use
Not properly identifying the user agent such that it accurately describes the consumer of the API
Misrepresenting the consuming client by impersonating other user agents in an attempt to obfuscate API requests
Other services designed to fraudulently represent the Have I Been Pwned name or brand
Misrepresenting the source of the data as originating from somewhere other than Have I Been Pwned
Not adhering to the Creative Commons Attribution License as described below
Automating the consumption of other APIs not explicitly documented on this page
Using the service in a fashion that brings Have I Been Pwned into disrepute
Abusing these objectives may limit your ability to query the service via a range of countermeasures.
Those countermeasures may impact other consumers of the API if they share network services with an abusive user.
If in doubt, get in touch and outline how you'd like to use the service in a way that's consistent with these objectives.

In other words, you're welcome to use the public API to build other services, but you must identify Have I Been Pwned as the source of the data .
Clear and visible attribution with a link to haveibeenpwned.com should be present anywhere data from the service is used including when searching breaches or pastes and when representing breach descriptions.
It doesn't have to be overt, but the interface in which Have I Been Pwned data is represented should clearly attribute the source per the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

In order to help maximise adoption, there is no licencing or attribution requirements on the Pwned Passwords API, although it is welcomed if you would like to include it.
